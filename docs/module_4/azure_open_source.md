# Azure services for open-source databases

In addition to Azure SQL services, Azure data services are available for other popular relational database systems, including MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL. 

## Azure Database for MySQL

MySQL started life as a simple-to-use open-source database management system. It's the leading open source relational database for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP) stack apps. 

It's available in several editions: Community, Standard, and Enterprise. The Community edition is available free-of-charge, and has historically been popular as a database management system for web applications, running under Linux.

**Azure Database for MySQL** is a PaaS implementation of MySQL in the Azure cloud, based on the MySQL Community Edition.

## Azure Database for MariaDB

MariaDB is a newer database management system, created by the original developers of MySQL. The database engine has since been rewritten and optimized to improve performance. 

MariaDB offers compatibility with Oracle Database. 

One notable feature of MariaDB is its built-in support for *temporal data*. A table can hold several versions of data, enabling an application to query the data as it appeared at some point in the past.

**Azure Database for MariaDB** is a PaaS implementation of the MariaDB database management system adapted to run in Azure. It's based on the MariaDB Community Edition.

## Azure Database for PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a hybrid relational-object database. You can store data in relational tables, but a PostgreSQL database also enables you to store custom data types, with their own non-relational properties. 

The database management system is extensible; you can add code modules to the database, which can be run by queries. Another key feature is the ability to store and manipulate geometric data, such as lines, circles, and polygons.

PostgreSQL has its own query language called *PL/pgSQL*. This language is a variant of the standard relational query language, SQL, with features that enable you to write stored procedures that run inside the database.

**Azure Database for PostgreSQL** is a PaaS implementation of the PostgreSQL database management system adapted to run in Azure. Some features of on-premises PostgreSQL databases aren't available in Azure Database for PostgreSQL. These features are mostly concerned with the extensions that users can add to a database to perform specialized tasks.
