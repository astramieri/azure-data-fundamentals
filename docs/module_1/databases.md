# Explore databases

A database is used to define a central system in which data can be stored and queried.

## Relational databases

Relational databases are commonly used to store and query structured data. 
The data is stored in **tables** that represent entities. Each instance of an entity is assigned a **primary key** that uniquely identifies it. Primary keys are used to reference the entity instance in other tables. 

This use of keys to reference data entities enables a relational database to be **normalized** which in part means the elimination of duplicate data values. 

The tables are managed and queried using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**, which is based on an ANSI standard, so it's similar across multiple database systems.
