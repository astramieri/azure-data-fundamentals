# Identify data formats

You can classify data as:
- structured
- semi-structured
- unstructured

There are two broad categories of data store in common use:
- file stores
- databases

## Structured data

Structured data is data that adheres to a **fixed schema**, so all of the data has the same fields or properties. 

Most commonly, the data is represented in one or more **tables** that consist of rows to represent each instance of a data entity, and columns to represent attributes of the entity.

Structured data is often stored in a database in which multiple tables can reference one another by using key values in a *relational model*.

## Semi-structured data

Semi-structured data is information that has some structure, but which allows for some variation between entity instances.

One common format for semi-structured data is *JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)*.

## Unstructured data

Not all data is structured or even semi-structured. For example, documents, images, audio and video data, and binary files might not have a specific structure. This kind of data is referred to as unstructured data.
