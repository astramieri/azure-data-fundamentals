# Explore SQL

**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is used to communicate with a relational database. It's the standard language for relational database management systems.

Many database management systems also have their own additional proprietary extensions to handle the specifics of that database management system. These extensions provide functionality not covered by the SQL standard, and include areas such as security management and programmability.

Some popular dialects of SQL include:
- **Transact-SQL (T-SQL)**: this version of SQL is used by Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL services
- **pgSQL**: this is the dialect used by PostgreSQL
- **PL/SQL**: this is the dialect used by Oracle

## SQL statement types

SQL statements are grouped into three main logical groups:
- Data Control Language (DCL)
- Data Definition Language (DDL)
- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
