# SQL

**Structured Query Language (SQL)** is used to communicate with a relational database. It's the standard language for relational database management systems.

Many database management systems also have their own additional proprietary extensions to handle the specifics of that database management system. These extensions provide functionality not covered by the SQL standard, and include areas such as security management and programmability.

Some popular dialects of SQL include:
- **T-SQL**: this is the dialect used Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL services
- **pgSQL**: this is the dialect used by PostgreSQL
- **PL/SQL**: this is the dialect used by Oracle

## SQL statement types

SQL statements are grouped into three main logical groups:
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)**
    - used to define the database schema
- **Data Query Language (DQL)**
    - used for performing queries on the data
- **Data Control Language (DCL)**
    - used to define rights, permissions and other controls
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**
    - used to manipule data in the database
- **Transaction Control Language (TCL)**
    - used for controlling transaction within the database
