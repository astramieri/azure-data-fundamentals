# Understand relational data

In a relational database, you model collections of **entities** from the real world as tables. A table contains rows, and each row represents a single instance of an entity.

Relational tables are a format for **structured data**, and each row in a table has the same columns.

Each column stores data of a specific datatype. The available datatypes that you can use when defining a table depend on the database system you are using.
