# Explore job roles in the world of data

There's a wide variety of roles involved in managing, controlling, and using data. Some roles are business-oriented, some involve more engineering, some focus on research, and some are hybrid roles that combine different aspects of data management. 

The three key job roles that deal with data in most organizations are:
- **database administrators** manage databases, assigning permissions to users, storing backup copies of data and restore data in the event of a failure
- **data engineers** manage infrastructure and processes for data integration across the organization, applying data cleaning routines, identifying data governance rules, and implementing pipelines to transfer and transform data between systems
- **data analysts** explore and analyze data to create visualizations and charts that enable organizations to make informed decisions

The roles described here represent the key data-related roles found in most medium to large organizations. There are additional data-related roles not mentioned here, such as data scientist and data architect; and there are other technical professionals that work with data, including application developers and software engineers.
