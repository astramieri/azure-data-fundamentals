# Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

Azure Data Lake Store (Gen1) is a separate service for hierarchical data storage for analytical data lakes, often used by so-called big data analytical solutions that work with structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data stored in files. 

**Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** is a newer version of this service that is integrated into Azure Storage enabling you to take advantage of the scalability of blob storage and the cost-control of storage tiers, combined with the **hierarchical file system capabilities** and compatibility with major analytics systems of Azure Data Lake Store.

To create an Azure Data Lake Store Gen2 files system, you must enable the **Hierarchical Namespace** option of an Azure Storage account. 

You can do this when initially creating the storage account, or you can upgrade an existing Azure Storage account to support Data Lake Gen2. Be aware however that upgrading is a **one-way process**. After upgrading a storage account to support a hierarchical namespace for blob storage, you canâ€™t revert it to a flat namespace.

Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 implements an access control model that supports both Azure role-based access control (Azure RBAC) and POSIX-like access control lists (ACLs).

Azure Data Lake Store is compatible with the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Hadoop jobs can be run through Azure HDInsight that can write and read data in the Data Lake Store efficiently.
