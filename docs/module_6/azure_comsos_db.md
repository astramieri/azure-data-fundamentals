# Describe Azure Cosmos DB

**Azure Cosmos DB** supports multiple application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable developers to use the programming semantics of many common kinds of data store to work with data in a Cosmos DB database. 

The internal data structure is **abstracted**, enabling developers to use Cosmos DB to store and query data using APIs with which they're already familiar.

Cosmos DB uses **indexes** and **partitioning** to provide fast read and write performance and can scale to massive volumes of data. 

You can enable **multi-region writes**, adding the Azure regions of your choice to your Cosmos DB account so that globally distributed users can each work with data in their local replica.

## When to use Cosmos DB

Cosmos DB is a **highly scalable database management system**. 

Cosmos DB automatically allocates space in a container for your partitions, and each partition can grow up to 10 GB in size. Indexes are created and maintained automatically. There's virtually no administrative overhead.

Cosmos DB is highly suitable for the following scenarios:
- **Web and Mobile Applications**
- **Retail and Marketing**
- **IoT and Telematics**
- **Gaming**
