# Describe Power BI tools and workflow

**Microsoft Power BI** is a suite of tools and services that data analysts can use to build interactive data visualizations for business users to consume.

## Power BI Desktop

A typical workflow for creating a data visualization solution starts with **Power BI Desktop**, a Microsoft Windows application in which you can:
- **import data** from a wide range of data sources
- **combine and organize the data** from these sources in an analytics data model
- **create reports** that contain interactive visualizations of the data

## Power BI Service

After you've created data models and reports, you can publish them to the **Power BI service**, a cloud service in which reports can be published and interacted with by business users. 

You can also **do some basic data modeling and report editing** directly in the service using a web browser, but the functionality for this is limited compared to the Power BI Desktop tool. 

You can use the service to **schedule refreshes** of the data sources on which your reports are based, and to share reports with other users. 

You can also **define dashboards and apps** that combine related reports in a single, easy to consume location.

## Power BI Mobile

Users can consume reports, dashboards, and apps in the Power BI service through a web browser, or on mobile devices by using the **Power BI Mobile**.
